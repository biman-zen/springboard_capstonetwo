Capstone Two: Craigslist Car Dataset
The project involves the dataset found from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
The data was generated by scraping Craigslist and Carvana websites in 2021.
This capstone outlines the data science process:
	1. Problem identification 
	2. Data wrangling
	3. Exploratory data analysis
	4. Prep-processing and training data development
	5. Modeling
 
As this was my first raw dataset, the majority of the work occured with performing feature engineering i.e. cleaning the data to be suitable for modeling. 
In the end, some of the data was discarded and four different models (including KNN and Random Forest regression models) were evaluated with 5-fold cross validation. The best model had an average error rate of 1.5%.  
The final results are discussed in CapstoneII_FinalReport_CLUsedCarDataset.pdf
