# Capstone Two
Predict the price of a used car using the data science process.
1. Problem identification 
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Prep-processing and training data development
5. Modeling

The project involves the dataset found from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). The data was generated by scraping Craigslist and Carvana websites in 2021.
This was my first attempt to wrangle a large dataset from scratch. The majority of the work occured with performing feature engineering i.e. cleaning the data to be suitable for modeling. 
In the end, some of the data was discarded and four different models (including KNN and Random Forest regression models) were evaluated with 5-fold cross validation. The best model had an average error rate of 1.5%.  
The results of the analysis are discussed in detail in the report "CapstoneII_FinalReport_CLUsedCarDataset.pdf".
